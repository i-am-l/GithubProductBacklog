These files are from the QJson json parsing library, version 0.5.0

http://qjson.sourceforge.net/

Rather than linking a library, we've just included the required files directly, according to
http://qjson.sourceforge.net/get_it/unix.html

All of the parser classes are found within the QJson namespace.

The original README is below (without the Install section)

Description
-----------
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
  It can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of value, and a collection of name/value pairs.

  QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects.
  JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON's objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.

Happy hacking
